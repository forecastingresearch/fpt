Based on other states' experiences with the programs, estimates of the outcomes that can be expected from each program can be made. Assume for purposes of this decision that these estimates of the outcomes are accurate and are as follows:</p>
                                <p style=""margin-left: 30px"">If Program A is adopted, 600 of the 1000 students will drop out of school.</p>
                                <p style=""margin-left: 30px"">If Program B is adopted, there is a 40% chance that none of the 1000 students will drop out of school and 60% chance that all 1000 students will drop out of school.</p>
