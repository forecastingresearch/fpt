                                <p>Imagine that in one particular state it is projected that 1000 students will drop out of school during the next year. Two programs have been proposed to address this problem, but only one can be implemented. Based on other states' experiences with the programs, estimates of the outcomes that can be expected from each program can be made. Assume for purposes of this decision that these estimates of the outcomes are accurate and are as follows:</p>
                                <p style=""margin-left: 30px"">If Program A is adopted, 600 of the 1000 students will drop out of school.</p>
