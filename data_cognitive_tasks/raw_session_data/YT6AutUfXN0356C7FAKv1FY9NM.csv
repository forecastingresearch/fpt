                                <p style=""margin-left: 30px"">If Program A is adopted, 600 of the 1000 students will drop out of school.</p>
                                <p style=""margin-left: 30px"">If Program B is adopted, there is a 40% chance that none of the 1000 students will drop out of school and 60% chance that all 1000 students will drop out of school.</p>
