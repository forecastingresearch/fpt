                ",,"nothing went wrong. these questions are weirder calls to make than previous weeks because there's not always a clear difference between the definite bad outcome in the first option and the risk-adjusted possible bad outcome in the second option - previous weeks were about numeracy and this feels like it's more about risk tolerance. also the one about radiation vs. surgery is a bit different because you've got up to 5 years of life for a slightly larger group vs. 10 die right away. more people die in the latter outcome, but you think about the distribution across the 5 years and it seems like the better one vs. 10 dying immediately. perhaps this is by design but this particular question feels like that is testing a different thing than the other questions by introducing a third variable (good outcome now, bad outcome now, AND bad outcome later).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
