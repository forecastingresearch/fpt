                                <p>Imagine a hospital is treating 32 injured soldiers, who are all expected to lose one leg. There are two doctors that can help the soldiers, but only one can be hired:</p>
                                <p style=""margin-left: 30px"">If Doctor A is hired, 20 soldiers will keep both legs.</p>
                                <p style=""margin-left: 30px"">If Doctor B is hired, there is a 63% chance that all soldiers keep both legs and a 37% chance that nobody will save both legs.</p>
                                <p>Which doctor do you recommend?</p>",1.0,2,True,rc1_7,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
