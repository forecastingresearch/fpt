Data processing and data structure follows the same format as that for the main experiment. For detail see [in the main experiment folder](../data_cognitive_tasks/README.md).

The main difference involves a technical error where a single participant was able to complete one wave more than once (this was prevented in the main experiment) and that some participants, especially for wave 3, saw all tasks and not a specific form. To rectify this, we kept only the first completed session for any given participant and if a task, meant to be completed only once, was done more than once, we kept the responses from the first exposure.

There were also additional conditions here: incentive (different payment schedules) and recruitment (either invited to complete wave 0 or not).
